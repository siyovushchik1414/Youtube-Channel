This is one of the best qualities of the Python language, because there are many languages that have a lot of complexities.For example, C++, despite its many advantages, is not understood by everyone from the first time. I myself, adore C++ and firmly believe that it is one the best languages I have ever used because it is fast and concrete. And of course, I have started my journey with programming with C++ language."

    "The python language can be downlodad from it's official website: python.org. But I strongly recommend using Anaconda Navigator. Anaconda Navigator is a free and open-source package that allows you to install and use Python, and it's a great way to get started with Python. It has a lot of advantages and features. I can tell you that one of the most important features of it is that it allows you to easily install, for example, tensoflow-gpu in Windows. If some of you ever tried to install it, on windows, you will understand what I mean. "
